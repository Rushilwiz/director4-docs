# Clubs - Getting Started

Clubs sanctioned by the eighth period office can request a website under the activities.tjhsst.edu domain.

A club can have only one site on Director. No new Director sites may be created for one-off activities, fundraisers, or other club events.

Someone responsible for the club (typically a webmaster or other officer or official) must fill out the Activity Request form (located [here](https://director.tjhsst.edu/request/)), and request approval from the official sponsor as designated by the Eighth Period office.
