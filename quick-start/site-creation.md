# Site Creation

First, go to [https://director.tjhsst.edu](https://director.tjhsst.edu). Then follow the instructions below, depending on which type of site you want.

When you're done, take a look at [Site Configuration](site-configuration.md).

### Personal website

Personal websites are designed for use by a single user.

To create a personal site, select "Create webdocs" in the upper right corner of the page. Enter a description for your site and select the site type (see [Selecting your site type](#selecting-your-site-type) below). Then click the "Create site" button at the bottom.

### Club/activity website

To request a website for a club or other activity, click "Create Site" in the upper right corner of the page. then click the "site request form" link in the yellow box at the top.

Enter the name of the activity, select the teacher who will approve your site request (this should almost always be your activity's sponsor), and put in any extra information you feel is necessary. Click "Save" to submit the site request.

Once the teacher you requested has approved your request, a Sysadmin will handle creating the actual site. Please allow some time (up to 3-5 business days) after the teacher's approval for this to happen.

### Project site

Project sites are intended for:

1. Projects that you're working on with other users
2. Side projects that you don't want to add to your personal website

For example, your final project for Web Development class would be a perfect use of a project site (whether you're working on it with a partner or by yourself).

To create a project site, click "Create Site" in the upper right corner of the page. Enter the site name and description, select the site type (see [Selecting your site type](#selecting-your-site-type) below), and select the users who should have access to the site (be sure to include yourself). The click the "Create site" button at the bottom.

**Do NOT use project sites for club websites.** Any project site that is found to actually be a club website may be suspended without warning.

## Selecting your site type

*Static* sites are for sites with just plain HTML, CSS, and Javascript. These have no server-side code running and are not very flexible.

*Dynamic* sites run a separate server (such as Node.js, Flask, or Django) to serve content.

<small>Note: Previous versions of Director had a "PHP" site type. While it is strongly recommended that you use alternative web frameworks, it is still possible to use PHP on Director sites. To do this, select "Dynamic" and see the [PHP Framework Guide](/framework-guides/php.md).</small>
