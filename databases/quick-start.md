# Database Quick Start

Navigate to the information page for the site you want to add a database to and click `Add Database` under the `Databases` section.

You should see two choices. Select the one that says `(PostgreSQL)` if you want a Postgres database; select the one that says `(MySQL)` if you want a MySQL database.

Click `Create Database` to create the database. You're done! For next steps, see the [PostgreSQL](postgresql.md) or [MySQL](mysql.md) pages, as appropriate.
