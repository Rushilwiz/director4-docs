# PHP

**WARNING**: Using PHP for Director sites is discouraged. We strongly recommend that you use a more modern framework like [Django](django.md).

To use PHP on Director, set the site type to `Dynamic` and choose the `PHP` image. You will need to use the default `run.sh` template, or at least something based off of it.

After that, everything should "just work."
