# Policies: Resource Limits

Each site on Director is allocated a limited amount of resources to prevent abuse of Director. Most, if not all, sites should be served adequately with these resources allotted to each site.

* 0.6 of a CPU core
* 100 MB of RAM

If you believe that you have a good reason why your site needs more resources than this, email [director@tjhsst.edu](mailto:director@tjhsst.edu).
