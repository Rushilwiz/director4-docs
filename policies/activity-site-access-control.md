# Policies: Activity Site Access Control

When a request is received for access to an activity's website, the Director admins will require adequate proof that the requesting user (student) is authorized to have access to the activity's website.

Adequate proof is typically defined as any one of:

* Confirmation from a TJ staff member sponsoring an activity.
* Confirmation from the Eighth Period office.

To request access to an activity's website, have the sponsor or the Eighth Period office email [director@tjhsst.edu](mailto:director@tjhsst.edu).
